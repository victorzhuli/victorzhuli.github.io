<ul>
<li><p>Make a list of links to other blog posts, articles, or studies that you like, and write brief summaries or highlight what you particularly like about them. Part of my first blog post came from my making just such a list, because I couldn’t believe more people hadn’t read the posts and articles that I thought were awesome.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Summarize what you learned at a conference you attended, or in a class you are taking.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Any email you’ve written twice should be a blog post. Now, if I’m asked a question that I think someone else would also be interested in, I try to write it up.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Don’t be a perfectionist. I spent 9 months on my <a href="https://medium.com/tech-diversity-files/if-you-think-women-in-tech-is-just-a-pipeline-problem-you-haven-t-been-paying-attention-cb7a2073b996">first blog post</a>, it went viral, and I have repeatedly hit new lows in readership ever since then. One of my personal goals for 2017 is to post my writing quicker and not to obsess so much before I post, because it just builds up pressure and I end up writing less.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You are best positioned to help people one step behind you. The material is still fresh in your mind. Many experts have forgotten what it was like to be a beginner (or an intermediate) and have forgotten why the topic is hard to understand when you first hear it. The context of your particular background, your particular style, and your knowledge level will give a different twist to what you’re writing about.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2016/05/22/how-do-you-write-blog-posts/">What would have helped you a year ago? What would have helped you a week ago?</a></p>
</li>
<li><p>Get angry. The catalyst that finally got me to start writing was when someone famous said something that made me angry. So angry that I had to explain all the ways his thinking was wrong.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you’re wondering about the actual logistics, <a href="https://medium.com/new-story">Medium</a> makes it super simple to get started. Another option is to use <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages/">Jekyll and Github pages</a>. I can personally recommend both, as I have 2 blogs and use one for each.</p>
